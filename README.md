- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @diptipman... I'm Thomas Parish.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... Theology. Neuroscience. Illustrating.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning............... Theology. Neuroscience. Illustrating
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ...Theology. Neuroscience. Illustrating.
- üì´ How to reach me ... I'm probably busy working or studying or illustrating.  I am not rich, in fact I AM a poor student. I have to exert effort out of necessity. I am busy.  Kindly asking that you contact me in written form via email 
- I will not respond to schitzophrenic babble.
I'm pro big-pharma and Technology.  Not a luddite. Never was.

- good things... THEOLOGY. Neuroscience. Art. Philosophy. Capitalism. Consent. Sweets. Bloody Steaks. Gorey films. Dreams, I like dreams a lot.  Also rap, I rap when enwrapped within this holy spirit, similar to speaking in tounges, it's a secret though lol.
- Bad Things... widespread vegetarianism/rigid caste assignment/delusions of reincarnation or Karma/Coercion :)
- BORN ON THE 11th of NOVEMEBER 1992 AT 10:30AM IN AUSTRALIA MIRANDA I CAME INTO PHYSICAL EXISTENCE. STOP BEING A FUCKING CUNT. I ENJOY SPENDING MONEY ON WATER, I ALSO LIKE GIVING GIFTS.  I LIKE CATHOLICISM, I FIND THE INSITUTION FASCINATING AND THINK THEIR LEADERS ARE CLEVER, THEY DESERVE FINE WINE, PROSPERITY, AND TRUST, they're actually awesome.
- I HAVE ADHD.  I STILL REQUIRE GOOD GRADES. PEAK IQ SCORE IS 144 - I DO NOT CARE I AM STILL ADHD AND THAT MAKES ME STUPID lol (prepare to feel frustration). SO HAVE PATIENCE WITH ME. I AM ALSO VERY IMPULSIVE IN CONVERSATION, VERY COMPLEX IN CONVERSATION, REQUIRE A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF INTELLECTUAL AND LIMBIC STIMULATION.  I AM NOT MOTIVATED THROUGH EXTERNALITIES, ADHD PREVENTS ME FROM THAT, I MUST DESIRE TO DO THINGS, SUCH DESIRE GENERALLY ONLY OCCURS VIA INTELLECTUAL OR CREATIVE CURIOSITY (ALSO ADHD MEDICATION HELPS A LOT, I LOVE MY PRESCRIBED STIMULANT MEDICATION COMBINED WITH PRODUCTIVE INTELLECTUAL WORK MORE THAN MOST THINGS) WHICH MEANS MY PARENTS GAVE UP ON PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT VERY EARLY ON WITH ME, WHEREAS MY SIBLINGS WERE VERY RESPONSIVE TO PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT. NOT ME THOUGH, I WONT LEARN A THING FROM BEING HIT.  DO NOT HIT YOUR CHILDREN, IF I SEE YOU SMACK A CHILD I WILL HURT YOU.
- WORK HISTORY: (12 to 23, I'm not joking - Work is good, let children work) BLUE COLLAR WORK, HOSPITALITY WORK, COMMUNITY WORK (TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM AND OLD PEOPLE WITH DIMENTIA), HOSPITAL WORK (OPERATIONS ASSISTANT, WARDSPERSON, ASSISTANT IN NURSING), (OVER 23) PROFESSIONAL WORK (NEUROMARKETING, INDUSTRY MARKET ANALYST, ADVERTISING AND COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCHER, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, DIGITAL STRATEGIST, MARKET INTERVIEWER).
- ACADEMIC HISTORY: BACHELORS (NEUROSCIENCE), GRADUATE (MARKETING), MASTERS (THEOLOGY)
- FUTURE ACADEMICS: PhD NEUROTHEOLOGY (AND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THERE, IRRESPECTIVE OF MY ADHD).

- STOP BEING A CUNT.

- I'm going to focus on developing a strong torso and limbs, also, if I ever decide to play football it'll only occur in light of competency in at least one combat sport.

- I dont hold grudges <3
